# Mushroom-Classification--Build-ML-Models-from-Scratch-using-Numpy

The focus of this project is to investigate the complex nonlinear relationships between the 
concentration of 20 different variables in order to create a prediction system that can accurately 
classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous. The development of such a system is essential for 
ensuring consumer safety and preventing health issues. By utilizing the variables, we have 
identified, we will build a prediction system that can generate a warning if a mushroom is deemed 
poisonous. Our ultimate goal is to create a model with high performance metrics that can accurately 
classify mushrooms and provide the most accurate information possible to the user. With this 
project, we hope to contribute to the development of a tool that can effectively identify edible 
mushrooms and prevent any health risks associated with consuming poisonous ones.
